ABOUT

Ciabatta - An implementation of CRT for x86-64 windows and linux platforms.
What are the advantages over using your default CRT? I dunno but you can if you
want. I haven't ran any benchmarks or verified compliance yet, so use at your
own risk. Some functionality is way more sexier than your normal-ass CRT tho,
so you might consider switching.


USAGE

In order to build the library you need to have clang installed. Download the
source code, then run bake.cmd. Copy `ciabatta.lib` to a good place in your
project.

Don't forget to include ciabatta's include directory:
    /I inc (MSVC CL)
    -I inc (Clang)

For MSVC LINK add the following arguments:
    /nodefaultlibs
    ciabatta.lib
    kernel32.lib
    user32.lib
    shell32.lib

Link flags for average copy-paste enjoyers:
    /nodefaultlibs ciabatta.lib kernel32.lib user32.lib shell32.lib

(TODO: usage for clang)
